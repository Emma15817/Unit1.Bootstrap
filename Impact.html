<h2>What impact does it have on our body?</h2>

    <h6>A series of various chemicals are released into the atmosphere when burning the fossil fuels that we consume every day. We breath air every day, and that has a direct impact towards our health, even though it merely recognized. According to WHO (worlds health organisation) intaking polluted air causes the following:</h6>

    <h6>Breathing polluted air puts you at a higher risk for asthma and other respiratory diseases.</h6>

    <h6>When exposed to ground ozone for 6 to 7 hours, scientific evidence show that healthy people’s lung function decreased and they suffered from respiratory inflammation.</h6>

    <h6>Air pollutants are mostly carcinogens and living in a polluted area can put people at risk of Cancer.</h6>

    <h6>Coughing and wheezing are common symptoms observed on city folks.</h6>

    <h6>Damages the immune system, endocrine and reproductive systems.</h6>

    <h6>High levels of particle pollution have been associated with higher incidents of heart problems.</h6>

    <h6>The burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are causing the Earth to become warmer.</h6>

    <h6>The toxic chemicals released into the air settle into plants and water sources. Animals eat the contaminated plants and drink the water. The poison then travels up the food chain – to us.</h6>

    <h2>What Impact Does It Have On The Environment?</h2>

    <h6>Just like the air we breathe, water is vital to our survival. We need clean water to drink, to irrigate our crops and the fish we eat live in the waters. We play in rivers, lakes and streams – we live near bodies of water. It’s a precious resource that can easily be polluted and the contamination can be transferred to us and affect our health.</h6>

    <h6>Diseases such as amoebiasis, typhoid and hookworm are caused by polluted drinking water. Water polluted by chemicals such as heavy metals, lead, pesticides and hydrocarbon can cause hormonal and reproductive problems, damage to the nervous system, liver and kidney damage and cancer – to name a few. Being exposed to mercury causes Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, heart disease and death. A polluted beach causes rashes, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, encephalitis, stomach aches and vomiting.</h6>

    <h2>What Harmful Consequences Can Be Inflicted Into A Child?</h2>

    <h6>Air pollution has a disastrous effect on children. Worldwide, up to 14% of children aged 5 – 18 years have asthma relating to factors including air pollution. Every year, 543 000 children* younger than 5 years die from respiratory disease linked to air pollution. Air pollution is also linked to childhood cancers. Pregnant women are exposed to air pollution, it can affect fetal brain growth. Air pollution is also linked to cognitive impairment in both children and adults. story and let your visitors know a little more about you.</h6>

    <h6>Other Effects:</h6>

    <h6>Their lungs are still developing, and air pollution can interfere with this biological process.</h6>

    <h6>Their bodies are less able to metabolize, detoxify, and excrete the toxicants contained in air pollution.</h6>

    <h6>Their brains are still developing, and neurotoxic compounds in air pollution can affect children’s cognitive development.</h6>

    <h6>They inhale more air per unit of bodyweight than adults.</h6>

    <h6>Babies born to women who were exposed to air pollution during their pregnancy are more likely to be premature and low birthweight</h6>
