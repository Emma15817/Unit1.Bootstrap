    <h2>Household Pollution</h2>
    <h6>Household air pollution kills 4 million people a year and tends to affect countries in Africa and Asia, where polluting fuels and technologies are used every day particularly at home for cooking, heating and lighting. Women and children, who tend to spend more time indoors, are affected the most. The main pollutants: are particulate matter, a mix of solid and liquid droplets arising mainly from fuel combustion and road traffic; nitrogen dioxide from road traffic or indoor gas cookers; sulphur dioxide from burning fossil fuels; and ozone at ground level, caused by the reaction of sunlight with pollutants from vehicle emissions.
    
        The pollutant that affects people the most is particulate matter. While particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less, (≤ PM10) can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs, the even more health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, (≤ PM2.5). These particles are so small that 60 of them make up the width of a human hair. PM2.5 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system. They can increase the risk of heart and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer. Ozone is a major factor in causing asthma (or making it worse), and nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide can also cause asthma, bronchial symptoms, lung inflammation and reduced lung function.</h6>
