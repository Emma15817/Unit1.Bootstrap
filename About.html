    <h2>What is Pollution?</h2>
    
    <h6>Take a deep breath. Every single minute, the average human breaths in <b>10L of air </b>, and after exercise, it can <b>increase by 2.5x more</b>. Yet, the vast majority of people do not know what they are intaking, nor the impact it has on their bodies. Pollution is the presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance which has <b>harmful</b> or <b>poisonous effects</b>. These substances that cause pollution are reffered to as <b>pollutants</b>. These polluting substances including gases (such as <b>carbon dioxide</b>, <b>carbon monoxide</b>, <b>sulphur dioxide</b>, <b>nitrous oxides</b>, <b>methane and chlorofluorocarbons</b>), particulates (both <b>organic</b> and <b>inorganic</b>), and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's <b>atmosphere</b>. These pollutants are so diverse and they include <b>chemical products</b>, <b>waste material</b>, <b>light</b>, <b>heat</b>, and <b>noise</b> among others. Due to the diverse nature of pollutants in the world, there are various types of pollution such as <b>water pollution</b>, <b>noise pollution</b>, <b>air pollution</b>, <b>soil contamination</b>, <b>radioactive pollution</b>, and <b>plastic pollution</b>. While some pollution occurs through natural events such as <b>volcanic eruptions</b> and <b>forest fires</b>, most of the pollution in the world is <b>caused by human activities</b>. </h6>

        Air pollution is hard to escape, no matter how rich an area you live in. It is all around us. Microscopic pollutants in the air can slip past our body’s defences, penetrating deep into our respiratory and circulatory system, damaging our lungs, heart and brain. Air pollution is closely linked to climate change; the main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution, and efforts to mitigate one can improve the other. This month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that coal-fired electricity must end by 2050 if we are to limit global warming rises to 1.5C. If not, we may see a major climate crisis in just 20 years <i>(Leniners, 2018)</i>.</h6>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Pollution in China</h2>
        
        <h6>China’s air quality is, to put it bluntly, very bad. In 2007, it was estimated that out of the 560 million Chinese city dwellers, only one percent breathed air deemed to be safe by the European Union. In fact, air pollution is estimated to have led to the premature deaths of 1.58 million Chinese citizens in 2016, and has no doubt compromised the health of millions more. While tragic, this isn’t surprising, given the vast number of large studies that have linked air pollution to low birth weight, miscarriages, lung disease, cognitive impairment, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and a host of other chronic health conditions which can significantly reduce both quality of life and lifespan. The primary reason for China’s polluted air is emissions from coal plants.</h6>
        
        <h6>The rate at which the country consumes coal is monumental. Even as recently as 2016, coal generated 62% of China’s electricity. All in all, it’s estimated that 1 out of every 4 metric tons of coal humanity burns are burned in China. In addition to releasing carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming, coal burning plants emit a vast number of chemicals that are damaging to both human health and the environment. The list of said chemicals includes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead, cadmium, mercury, volatile organic compounds, arsenic, and PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter). These are the compounds responsible for creating the public health crisis described above.

        </h6>

        <h6>Though the Chinese government has a long history of prioritizing growth above the health of its populace (a tendency largely responsible for the crisis described above) it has also quickly come to realize the severity of these air pollution issues, and has taken significant action to address them.</h6>

        <h6>Due to state funded efforts, China currently leads the world in terms of total installed solar photovoltaic capacity, and is continuing to invest heavily in renewables. There has also been a massive effort by the Chinese government to replace coal with natural gas, the emissions from which are quite a bit less dangerous for human health and the environment than those released by burning coal. The effects of these efforts have already become apparent; CNN reported last March that “average concentrations of pollutants fell in Chinese cities by 12% from 2017 to 2018, while the capital Beijing has fallen out of the top 100 most polluted cities following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.”</h6>
