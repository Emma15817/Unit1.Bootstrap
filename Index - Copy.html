                <h2>What Is Pollution?</h2>
                    <h6>Take a deep breath. Every single minute, the average human breaths in 10L of air, and after exercise, it can increase by 2.5x more. Yet, the vast majority of people do not know what they are intaking, nor the impact it has on their bodies. Pollution is the presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance which has harmful or poisonous effects. These substances that cause pollution are reffered to as pollutants. These polluting substances including gases (such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. These pollutants are so diverse and they include chemical products, waste material, light, heat, and noise among others. Due to the diverse nature of pollutants in the world, there are various types of pollution such as water pollution, noise pollution, air pollution, soil contamination, radioactive pollution, and plastic pollution. While some pollution occurs through natural events such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, most of the pollution in the world is caused by human activities. 

 

                Air pollution is hard to escape, no matter how rich an area you live in. It is all around us. Microscopic pollutants in the air can slip past our bodyâ€™s defences, penetrating deep into our respiratory and circulatory system, damaging our lungs, heart and brain. Air pollution is closely linked to climate change; the main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution, and efforts to mitigate one can improve the other. This month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that coal-fired electricity must end by 2050 if we are to limit global warming rises to 1.5C. If not, we may see a major climate crisis in just 20 years (Leniners, 2018).</h6>
